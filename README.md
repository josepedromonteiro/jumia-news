# Jumia New :newspaper:

Jumia News is a simple web app that lets you find the latest news and also search for them.

## Installation :wrench:
Run the npm install
```bash
npm i
```
Build and serve the application
```bash
ng serve
```
After that click on the link shown in the terminal.

### Optional - Run PWA

```
Access the link in your device and save it in the home screen

## Cool tips :information_desk_person:
* The app supports dark mode, based on your browser/OS theme;
* You can run the app as a PWA;
* In Safari, Chrome, and Edge you can see some really nice blurred effects.

## TODO :bow:
There's some parts missing...
* Functional Test;
* Unit Tests;
* Put the filters to work.
